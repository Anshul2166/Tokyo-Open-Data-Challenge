No long tail keyword stories. Sorry. No SEO formulas. None. No “guaranteed ways”. 0. Making more sales is not about reaching more people and pitching your products and services. Sales is about trust.

At a TEDx event, TEDTalks video and live speakers combine to spark deep discussion and connection in a small group. These local, self-organized events are branded TEDx, where x = independently organized TED event. The TED Conference provides general guidance for the TEDx program, but individual TEDx events are self-organized (subject to certain rules and regulations).,http://eventful.com/tokyo/events/teikyousalon-/E0-001-126129700-7?utm_source=apis&utm_medium=apim&utm_campaign=apic

These digital tokens have been commonly referred to as “security tokens” and an offering to investors of the tokens as a security token offering (“STO”). Today, a growing number of blockchain companies are planning and launching legally compliant security tokens that look increasingly like traditional investments. In addition, conventional businesses are embracing issuance of security tokens as a financing alternative, especially in light of the growing secondary market for such instrument, with platforms like OpenFinance, t0, SharesPost, DX.Exchange, and others going live. However, these companies are discovering that successfully launching an STO and later listing such security token on a regulated trading platform is a complex undertaking that requires careful consideration of a wide array of practical, technical and legal aspects. Please join our partners, Max Dilendorf and Rika Khurdayan as they take a deep dive into structuring, launching and listing a security token in compliance with US regulations. This workshop will cover: -        selecting appropriate jurisdiction for security token issuance -        setting up corporate structure and governance suitable for issuing security tokens -        security token formats and features (tokenomics) -        preparing necessary documentation for launching STO -        working with service providers to complete STO -        listing your security token on regulated trading platforms -        timeline for STO from start to finish -        live Q&A session (30 mins)   The workshop will also dissect 3 STO case studies: 1. Case Study: Profit Sharing Token (Step-by-Step Guide) 2. Case Study: Tokenized Equity of non-US company offered to US investors (Step-by-Step Guide) 3. Case Study: Tokenized Equity through US SPV (Step-by-Step Guide) Program Duration: 2.5 hours BONUS: Following the workshop, all attendees will receive Project Evaluation Checklist and, upon completion, will be offered to schedule a free 30 mins consultation to discuss the project and contemplated STO. This workshop is intended for informational and educational purposes only, and no attorney-client, fiduciary or other relationship whatsoever is formed by and between or among any persons attending and participating in this online workshop. Nothing contained in the presentation during the workshop constitutes legal advice or investment advice. ,http://eventful.com/tokyo/events/stepbystep-guide-launching-sto-tokyo-japan-/E0-001-126826079-2?utm_source=apis&utm_medium=apim&utm_campaign=apic

In addition to being Japan’s premier event on carbon capture and storage (CCS), this year’s Forum is a side event of ‘’G20 Ministerial Meeting on Energy Transitions and Global Environment for Sustainable Growth ‘’which will be held in KARUIZAWA from 15th to 16th June. The Forum is hosted by the Global CCS Institute, the world’s leading authority on carbon capture and storage (CCS). To be held in Tokyo on 12 June, the Forum will provide a unique opportunity to discuss the latest developments and future outlook for carbon capture and storage (CCS), and the role of this vital climate change mitigation technology in the development of a low carbon global economy. At COP24, the UNFCCC Climate Change Conference held in Poland in December 2018, the ‘Paris Agreement Work Programme’ was adopted to implement the long-term goals of Paris Agreement. The negotiations were based on scientific findings from the IPCC 1.5°C Special Report (SR15), that confirms CCS is the only mitigation technology able to decarbonize many large industrial sectors.  In Japan momentum for CCS continues to build as the requirement to consider the introduction of CCS at coal-fired power plants by 2030 and the effort to accelerate technology development of CCS for commercialization of CCS by around 2020, is compulsory. Free to attend, delegates will enjoy a day of presentations from leading dignitaries, policymakers, industry representatives and experts from across Japan, US, UK, the Asia Pacific region, and the globe. We believe this Forum will promote the understanding and deepen the discussion on the future of CCS deployment. Other information Simultaneous interpretation service will be provided at the event (English and Japanese). Agenda and presentation will be provided through this site shortly. Admission fee will be free for the forum however for the network reception follows the Japan CCS Forum 2019, 3,000 Japanese yen as fee will be collected at the event day.

DOSEM x KEN ISHII, 『Floorを大熱狂の渦に巻き込んだDOSEM x KEN ISHIIのスペシャルコラボパーティーがVisionにて実現。』 “カタルーニャの太陽”ことスペインの大人気DJ／プロデューサー、DOSEM 。彼はこれまで、香港の国際的テクノレーベルSINOや、Christian Smithが運営する老舗レーベルTRONIC、SUARAなどからヒットナンバーを放ち「Sonar Festival」、「Ultra Music Festival」、「EDC」など、数々のビッグフェスティバルで活躍し、ここ日本でも2013年の初来日から毎年のJapan Tourが好評を博し、その人気を確固たるものにした。 2019年。DOSEMの幼少期からの日本文化への特別な憧れ、リスペクトの象徴とも言える日本のテクノゴッド、KEN ISHIIを迎え入れたスペシャルコラボレーションパーティーがここVisionにて再現される。 一昨年に開催された東京でのショーケースパーティーも大団円の幕を閉じ、互いのラブコールに共鳴するかのごとく、開催される本公演は東京のテクノシーンに再び強烈なインパクトをもたらすに違いない。 またスペインの名門レーベル”Sincopat”からのリリースも好調なU:ICHI, 女性DJの中でも目覚ましい活躍を見せるSAKIKO OSAWA。DOSEMとも親交深く、彼のコンセプトを良く理解する二人のfront actにも注目したい。 より深く、よりエモーショナルに。 DOSEMの音楽性を最大限にパーティーとして引き出し、表現されるこの一夜を見逃す手はないはずだ。,http://eventful.com/tokyo/events/ken-ishii-alive-presents-weaves-feat-dosem-x-ken-ish-/E0-001-126349308-5?utm_source=apis&utm_medium=apim&utm_campaign=apic

No long tail keyword stories. Sorry. No SEO formulas. None. No “guaranteed ways”. 0. Making more sales is not about reaching more people and pitching your products and services. Sales is about trust. It is about “give before you take” mentality. It is about providing value. People generally won’t tell you why they will never buy your products and services. But people will definitely tell you why they bought your stuff because they already believed/invested in you. They will also tell you why they will buy from you. Yes, in the future… This means, “keep going like this boy, you are earning my trust”. Will you listen to these people?
